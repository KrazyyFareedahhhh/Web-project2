        <h1 style="text-align: center; background-color: #EECAD5; font-size: 50px; color: rgb(229, 151, 223);">WHAT ARE TREATIES?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color: white;">A treaty is a special agreement between two or more countries or groups.
            Treaties are like promises that people make, but between nations.
            For example, countries might sign a treaty to share resources, 
            protect the environment, or stop fighting. In Canada, there are 5 different treaties.
            Today, we will be talking about Treaty 3. 
        </p>
        <div class="d">
            <h1 style="text-align: center; color: white;">TREATY 3</h1>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">Treaty 3 was made in 1873 between the Anishinaabe people and the Canadian government.
            The Anishinaabe had lived on their land for thousand of years, hunting, fishing, and taking care of the environment.
            But then, new settlers started arriving, and the government wanted to build roads, railways and houses across the land.
            To do this, they needed permission from the people who already lived there. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">
            The Anishinaabe people agreed to share some of their land, but they didn't give it all away. They kept special areas called reserves where
            they could live, hunt, fish, and practice their traditions. In return, the government promised to give them things like money, tools, and help
            with education and farming. The Anishinaabe wanted to make sure their way of life would be protected and that they'd still have control over their land.
            So, Treaty 3 is important because it helped shape how people could live and work together on the land, even though it hasn't always been easy,
            and there have been challenges over the years. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">
            Treaty 3 is different from other treaties mainly because it covers a really big area in Canada where the Anishinaabe people live, 
            especially near lakes and rivers. Today, Treaty 3 reminds us how important it is to respect the agreements we make and to work together in 
            fairness and friendship, especially when it comes to sharing the land we all live on!
